        <h1>CHƯƠNG I</h1>
        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          The bat smashed into my face with such force that it crushed my nose into a
          distorted U-shape. The collision sent the soft tissue of my brain slamming into
          the inside of my skull. Immediately, a wave of swelling surged throughout my
          head. In a fraction of a second, I had a broken nose, multiple skull fractures, and
          two shattered eye sockets.<br/>
          When I opened my eyes, I saw people staring at me and running over to help.
          I looked down and noticed spots of red on my clothes. One of my classmates
          took the shirt off his back and handed it to me. I used it to plug the stream of
          blood rushing from my broken nose. Shocked and confused, I was unaware of
          how seriously I had been injured.<br/>
          My teacher looped his arm around my shoulder and we began the long walk to
          the nurse’s office: across the field, down the hill, and back into school. Random
          hands touched my sides, holding me upright. We took our time and walked
          slowly. Nobody realized that every minute mattered.<br/>
          When we arrived at the nurse’s office, she asked me a series of questions.
          “What year is it?”
          “1998,” I answered. It was actually 2002.
          “Who is the president of the United States?”
          “Bill Clinton,” I said. The correct answer was George W. Bush.
          “What is your mom’s name?”
          “Uh. Um.” I stalled. Ten seconds passed.
          “Patti,” I said casually, ignoring the fact that it had taken me ten seconds to
          remember my own mother’s name.<br/>
          That is the last question I remember. My body was unable to handle the rapid
          swelling in my brain and I lost consciousness before the ambulance arrived.
          Minutes later, I was carried out of school and taken to the local hospital.
          Shortly after arriving, my body began shutting down. I struggled with basic
          functions like swallowing and breathing. I had my first seizure of the day.
          I was rolled out of the emergency room doors and toward the helipad across
          the street. The stretcher rattled on a bumpy sidewalk as one nurse pushed me
          along while another pumped each breath into me by hand. My mother, who had
          arrived at the hospital a few moments before, climbed into the helicopter beside
          me. I remained unconscious and unable to breathe on my own as she held my
          hand during the flight.<br/>
          While my mother rode with me in the helicopter, my father went home to
          check on my brother and sister and break the news to them. He choked back
          tears as he explained to my sister that he would miss her eighth-grade graduation
          ceremony that night. After passing my siblings off to family and friends, he
          drove to Cincinnati to meet my mother.<br/>
          When my mom and I landed on the roof of the hospital, a team of nearly
          twenty doctors and nurses sprinted onto the helipad and wheeled me into the
          trauma unit. By this time, the swelling in my brain had become so severe that I
          was having repeated post-traumatic seizures. My broken bones needed to be
          fixed, but I was in no condition to undergo surgery. After yet another seizure—
          my third of the day—I was put into a medically induced coma and placed on a
          ventilator.<br/>
          My parents were no strangers to this hospital. Ten years earlier, they had
          entered the same building on the ground floor after my sister was diagnosed with
          leukemia at age three. I was five at the time. My brother was just six months old.
          After two and a half years of chemotherapy treatments, spinal taps, and bone
          marrow biopsies, my little sister finally walked out of the hospital happy,
          healthy, and cancer free. And now, after ten years of normal life, my parents
          found themselves back in the same place with a different child.<br/>
          While I slipped into a coma, the hospital sent a priest and a social worker to
          comfort my parents. It was the same priest who had met with them a decade
          earlier on the evening they found out my sister had cancer.<br/>
          As day faded into night, a series of machines kept me alive. My parents slept
          restlessly on a hospital mattress—one moment they would collapse from fatigue,
          the next they would be wide awake with worry. My mother would tell me later,
          “It was one of the worst nights I’ve ever had.”
